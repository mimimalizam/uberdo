# uberdo

If you'd like to use Go plugin for Vim, here is [one](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go).

# Some initial notes about my first GO app

```
$ cobra init ...

Your Cobra application is ready at
$GOPATH/src/github.com/<handle>/<app-name>


$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/<handle>/<app-name> && go build


$ ./uberdo

A longer description that spans multiple lines and likely contains
examples and usage of using your application. For example:

Cobra is a CLI library for Go that empowers applications.
This application is a tool to generate the needed files
to quickly create a Cobra application.


$ cobra add add

add created at $GOPATH/src/github.com/mimimalizam/uberdo/cmd/add.go

$ go build
```
